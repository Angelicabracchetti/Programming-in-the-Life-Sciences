# Overview: 
 # Research question
 Are any of the genetic predispositions for IBD also present in other diseases? 
# Explanation
It is known that IBD is not just a sporadic disease, but also has (to some extent) genetic predispositions. However, we also know that genetic predispositions are often not only related to one disease, but perhaps also with other diseases. In this project we will investigate whether IBD has any genetic predispositions in common with other diseases, such as autoimmune diseases. 
# Graphical display
Network analysis, in which diseases are represented as nodes and genetic predispositions are the edges that connect those nodes. The student can also consider using the size of the nodes or edges to show some additional information that they find useful.
